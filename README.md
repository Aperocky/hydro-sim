## Hydro-Sim

I used to spend countless day at the beach (especially those with water coming from wetsand up) digging channels and pits and dams, and then draining them. Water flowing across sand quickly creates features on a much shorter scale than nature at a great pace. A delta of sand can form in as soon as a minute, and these features are facinating.

I haven't been able to spend much time on the beach with flowing water, but what I do have is a computer. And I'm going to write a simulator that will grow those features, change climate and carry virtual sediments in a browser. So I can have (MY KIND OF) beach experience at my laptop.
